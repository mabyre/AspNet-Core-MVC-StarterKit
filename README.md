## Water passed under the bridge

I open the solution in 2023 with VS 2019 it works ! I can contemplate the immensity of the evolutions of ASP.NET Core.

To **run** this application, I could no more use IIS Epress, I have to choose AspNetCoreMVCStarterKit in run menu. Then it runs **AspNetCore.Server.Kestre** and a navigator at the adress :

http://localhost:62903

Next Step: I'll try to update as github asked to me.

Have fun!
